Polymorphism and Method Overriding
    1.The first rule is that an overridden method must be at least as accessible as the method it is overriding

    2.A subclass cannot declare an overridden method with a new or broader exception that in the superclass, since the method may be accessed using a reference to the superclass.

    3.Overridden methods must use covariant return types.
