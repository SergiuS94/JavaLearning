Static Interface Methods
    ->These methods are defined with the static keyword.
    ->A static method defined in a interface is NOT!!! inherited in any classes that implement the interface
    Rules:
        1.Like all methods in an interface, a static method is assumed to be public and will not compile if marked as private or protected
        2.To reference the static method, a reference to the name of the interface must be used.
