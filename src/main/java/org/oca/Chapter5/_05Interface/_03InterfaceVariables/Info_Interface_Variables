INTERFACE VARIABLES:
    ->assumed to be public
    ->assumed to be static final
There are two rules:
    1.Interface variables are assumed to be public, static and final. Therefore, marking a variable as private or protected will trigger a compiler error,
    as will marking any variable as abstract
    2.The value of an interface variable must be set when it is declared since it is marked as final
    ->So the interface variables are essentially constant variables defined on the interface level
