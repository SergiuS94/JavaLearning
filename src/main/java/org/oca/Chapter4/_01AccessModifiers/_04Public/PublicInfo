public    ->This method can be called from any class


In this example we have the DuckTeacher class in duck package
                    and the LostDuckling class in goose package

We can use the methods from DuckTeacher in LostDuckling because they were declared as public.
So we are allowed to use them in any package or class without inheriting that class.
